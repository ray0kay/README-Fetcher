# README-Fetcher
A side project I made that fetches GitHub README.mds
for absolutely no reason. (No like actually, I just did
it because I was bored)

## How to use
1. Install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't
2. Install pip [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) if you also haven't
3. Download the script and requirements.txt
4. Run this command in the terminal:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the script with arguments (See arguments section below)
6. Open `output.html`
7. You should see the README content
 
## Arguments
The first argument (required) is the README url. The second argument
(optional), is True or False (capital first letter). True if there
are images in the README, False if there aren't. If you do not specify
it, it defaults to false.

Example on Windows:
